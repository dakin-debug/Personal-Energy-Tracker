# Personal Energy Tracker (Beginner Python Project)

This is my first Python project! ðŸŽ‰

It's a simple command-line program that helps you estimate how much electricity your household appliances use each day and month.

What It Does

- Asks you to enter 5 appliances and how many hours per day you use them
- Calculates daily and monthly energy usage in kilowatt-hours (kWh)
- Helps you understand your energy habits better

ðŸ›  Built With

- Python
- Basic concepts: variables, user input, and simple math

ðŸ’¡ Example Output

Enter first appliance name: fan
Enter number of hours used per day: 4

Total Daily Usage: 1.1 kWh
Estimated Monthly Usage: 33.0 kWh



ðŸ§  What I Learned

- How to use `input()` to get user responses
- How to work with energy calculations using basic math
- How to use `eval()` to connect user input with appliance power ratings


This is part of my learning journey into Python and energy data science. Thanks for checking it out!
